                <h5>Mel has done all the delicious research on the ground for us (tough gig!), and shortlisted the very best places to grab a bite in the NT.</h5> <br><br>
                Melissa Leong is no stranger to travelling for good food. And her recent travels have taken her to Northern Territory, where she sampled the melting pot of South East Asian, South Asian and local Australian cuisine in a myriad of settings. <br><br>
                Here are her top five spots.<br><br>
                <h5>Ella, by Minoli </h5> <br>
                “Minoli is, hand on heart, one of the most talented cooks to come out of the MasterChef Australia kitchen during my time so far,” says Melissa of Minoli De Silva. “Her ability to translate her history and home to her food is truly magical, and I am just so happy to see her doing what she always dreamed she’d do.” A hidden haven in Darwin city, Ella by Minoli is tucked away in a quieter pocket of the CBD. It opened its doors in May and has been showcasing seasonal, local Northern Territory produce combined with modern Sri Lankan flavours ever since. <br><br>
                “Anyone who understands Sri Lankan cuisine knows that a dish can be good, but it’s about how it all comes together and is shared, that matters most,” says Melissa. “To that end, it was wonderful to share the table with more than just one other person, so we could have an all out feast. To see some of the dishes she thought up on the spot in the MasterChef kitchen, evolve into a restaurant dish, is amazing. I particularly loved her curry leaf cured snapper, vibing with pops of finger lime, rich with coconut dressing and spiked with curry leaf oil. The crispy roast pumpkin isn’t just a vego token option either, it’s layered, textural and a wonderful spectrum of sweet, savoury and sour.” <br><br>
                <h5>Tiwi Island Retreat </h5> <br>
                Set amongst a pristine marine sanctuary, with contemporary beach shack vibes, Tiwi Island Retreat is one of Australia’s premier barefoot destinations. Just a 30 minute light plane ride from Darwin and you will be transported to the exclusive beach front location, that makes for the perfect base to enjoy world-class fishing adventures, Indigenous culture tours and unique wildlife encounters. All of which Melissa rates as must-do experiences.  <br><br>
                “We witnessed crocs, sharks and a couple of local river dolphins coexisting happily near the resort,” says Melissa. “We went mud crabbing and fishing in the mangrove estuaries … I haven’t been fishing in years, and it was such a wonderful thing to jump in a tinny with our local guide Vince, crack a few ice cold beers in the heat, and throw a line out. I know it doesn’t really sound like something you’d catch me doing, but there is something deeply contemplating and relaxing about the simple repetition of casting and reeling that quietens my brain, while we listened to Vince tell us stories of the people and the place that we’re in. Being present is in short supply in my life at times, and this kind of activity really helps to reset that. Did I catch anything? Yes! A gold band snapper.” <br><br>
                Onsite, executive chef Travis Crane embraces the Top End’s Asian and Indigenous influence in his cooking that is accentuated by incredible Asian spices and bush tucker. All of which is served right on the sandy shores of the resort’s beach at sunset. <br><br>
                <h5>Finnis River Lodge </h5> <br>
                Finniss River Station has been running as a cattle station since 1987. But with the addition of a luxury lodge and infinity pool, paired with good food, the lodge has become a popular destination for foodies with a taste for luxury. <br><br>
                “If the infinity pool overlooking the lush green grassland of Finniss River Lodge wasn’t enough, the food really was amazing,” says Melissa. “It’s clear that chef Travis is inspired by the produce of this region, fusing it with a great sense of humour and considerable technical capability. I loved the perfectly executed lemon myrtle infused Basque cheesecake, there was also an elegant take on the pub classic parmie – made with crocodile, and shakshuka eggs bathing in a smoked tomatoey goodness” <br><br>
                <i>Related story: Hayden Quinn dishes up a taste of the Red Centre</i> <br>
                It’s not all soaking in the infinity pool and indulging in delicious food at Finniss River Lodge. “It’s always a privilege to stay on someone’s expansive farm property and being so far away from everywhere,” says Melissa. “Staying on this working cattle station, a property that encapsulates extensive wetlands, bushland, grazing country and the coast, along with its array of fauna … the quiet is enveloping and welcoming. Taking an ATV out to the paddock at sunset and having canapes and Champagne with the cows and a handful of pampered ponies, was just the kind of animal therapy we needed.” <br> <br>
                <h5>Rapid Creek Markets </h5> <br>
                If you know Melissa, you know how much she loves Darwin’s Rapid Creek Markets. In fact, it’s one of her favourite markets in Australia. “The sheer variety and quality of tropical-leaning produce is amazing. My favourite time to go is just after dawn, while the air is still cool, and the world is just waking up. If you close your eyes, and just take in the smells and sounds, you are reminded that we are indeed part of Southeast Asia,” says Melissa.  <br><br>
                “If you want access to incredible quality tropical produce with a Southeast Asian accent, you’d be hard pressed to find a better market. Haggle over plump, juicy mangoes, makrut lime leaves as long as your forearm, banana flowers, preserved eggs, or a fully stacked roti for breakfast after you’re done shopping, this market is Darwin in a warm, friendly nutshell. That’s my idea of a solid summer holiday.” <br><br>
                <h5>Darwin Harbour Cruise </h5> <br>
                There’s no better way to end a day in Darwin, than with a harbour cruise, and Melissa agrees. “If you really want a warm, glowy sunset over Darwin (and who doesn’t), then jump on a Darwin Harbour Cruise, head to the top deck and soak it up,” she says. “Book a table for a couple of friends and some sunset rosé and snacks to really make the most of golden hour with your best gals and guys. It’s really all about the antipasti platter and a bottle of something fizzy (beer or Prosecco) or pink (the aforementioned rosé).” <br> <br>
