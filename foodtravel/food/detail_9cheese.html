                <h1 style="color:#0386b1; font-weight: bold; font-size: 28px;">WHAT IS FETA / SIRENE (Bulgarian Cheese)?</h1> <br>
                <br>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="../image_food/9cheese.png" alt="9cheese" style="width:400px">
                </div> <br>
                Most listeners will have tried feta already. its a brined curd white cheese made from sheep’s milk or from a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk. It is a crumbly aged cheese, normally at least 3 months aged, commonly produced in blocks, and has a slightly grainy texture with a salty hit. <br> <br>
                The October 2002 European Union bill limits the term feta to mean a brined cheese mad only from sheep’s milk or a mix of sheep and goat’s milk, with a max 30% of goat’s milk. Feta must be made in certain regions of Greece, specifically: Peloponnese, Epirus, Thessaly, Central Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, plus the islands of Lesvos and Cephalonia. <br> <br>
                The biodiversity of the land coupled with the special breeds of sheep and goats used for milk is what gives feta cheese a specific aroma and flavor. Which is one of many reasons we’ll discuss why The name feta has become a protected origin product. <br> <br>
                It should be noted that, at time of recording, the USA has not accepted this protected status and feta cheese purchased in the USA may not have been produced in Greece. Though talks are underway on a massive trade deal between the EU and USA that would potentially change this. <br><br>
                <h3><i>Sirene (Bulgarian Cheese)</i></h3> <br>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="../image_food/9cheese_02.png" alt="9cheese" style="width:400px">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">BULGARIAN CHEESE ON THE SHOPSKA SALAD</p><br>
                Sirene Bulgarian Cheese can be made from a combination of goat, cow and sheep milk. There is no regulation on which, or the proportions. It’s is a little softer and wetter than feta cheese, but still crumbly and has a fat content of around 44-48%. It has a grain texture and slightly lemony flavor. I find it just a little creamier than feta, normally. <br><br>
                Bulgarian cheese is used for so many culinary applications, from salads to baked goods (like the Banitsa pastry), also in dips or added to other dishes. It may also be served as a table cheese. <br><br>
                <h3><i>Other White Cheese</i></h3> <br>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="../image_food/9cheese_03.png" alt="9cheese" style="width:400px">
                </div>
                <p style="text-align: center;">WHITE CHEESE IN MONTENEGRO</p><br>
                In Romania, the equivalent cheese is called “Telmea” <br><br>  
                Each brined white cheese from the Balkans and middle east are distinctly different but are made in a very similar way. The proportion and type of milk, the breed of animal the milk comes from, as well as the climate affect the final product. <br> <br>
                In Lebanon, as well as having imported Greek Feta cheese, they also have Bulghari – which is a separate product that mimics the free use of milk that Sirene does – mixing in cow’s milk as well. So it’s also important to remember that our narrow English culture view of cheese history is not the only way of looking at this. Other cultures are very aware of the difference between white cheeses across the region. <br><br>
                It’s fair to say these cheeses all taste different, though similar. It’s like comparing Grana Padano to Parmigiano Reggiano cheese – similar style, but different taste. I can say with certainty that the “Salad Cheese” we get at our current local supermarket in portugal is absolutely inferior to the certified Feta from the same store. Of course, differences can also be down to production style and quality, so our personal test is just that – not of any scientific rigour
                I have to say I loved almost all the good quality Bulgarian Sirene cheese. And Good feta is great too. It’s hard to say one is better than the other when it depends on individual batches and production. <br><br>
                History of Feta Cheese & White Cheese In General <br>
                Though food historians don’t know the exact origin of white cheese, it’s believed that cheese making existed since at least 8000 BC and could have started very close to original domestication of livestock – so possibly even as far back as 10,000 BC. <br><br>
                The oldest reference to White brined cheese is said to be from famous greek writer Homer’s Oddyssey, from 800BC. And I quote: <br><br>
                “We entered the cave, but he wasn’t there, only his plump sheep grazed in the meadow. The woven baskets were full of cheese, the folds were full of sheep and goats and all his pots, tubs and churns where he drew the milk, were full of whey. When half of the snow-white milk curdled he collected it, put it in the woven baskets, and kept the other half in a tub to drink,” Homer wrote. <br><br>
                Homer’s fiction suggests The Cyclops Polyphemus knew how to make Feta cheese – though it wasn’t called that at the time. The fictional description shows that Homer, and hence the people of Greece in general, were very familiar with the cheese making process and specifically white cheeses. <br><br>
                The ancient Greeks called the product which came from the coagulation of milk “τυρí,” (Tyri). <br><br>
                The name Feta translates as “slice” and began being used to describe the white cheese from the 17th century onwards, probably because of the way the cheese was sliced in barrels. <br><br>
                However, the word fetta – with two t’s – is the Italian word for slice, and etymologists confirm the word derives from the Italian and Latin before that, not from Greek. <br><br>
                The name Feta prevailed in the 19th century as the main term for the cheese in Greece. <br><br>
                Mass immigration from Greece in the 20th century to countries like Australia, USA, Canada and Germany helped spread Feta cheese and its production around the world and boosted its international profile. <br><br>
                At the same time, other cultures from around the region continued to make their own white cheese to their only local preferences, as they had done for thousands of years. Most have their own local names, but Feta became the generic term, especially in English, that was used to understand this general type of cheese as well as versions of it that were by the mid 20th century being made all over the world. <br><br>
                From Denmark, to the UK and USA, types of feta were being produced and marketed under that name. In Denmark specifically, their Feta was focused on Cows milk, quite different from the Sheep and goat milk feta of Greece. <br><br>
                In the 1990’s, Greece petitioned the EU to protect the origin of Feta by giving them a geographic designation and banning other cheesemakers from marketing under the name Feta. This bill was passed in 2002. <br><br>
                <h3>Celebrating With Sauvignon – Why It’s So Popular</h3> <br><br>
                <b><i>A Food Fun Travel Guest Post</i></b> <br> <br>
                Sauvignon blanc is a white wine grape that originates from the Bordeaux region of France. The grape is known for its high acidity and distinctive aromas, which can include notes of grass, grapefruit, and passionfruit. Sauvignon blanc is used to make both dry and sweet wines, although it is most commonly associated with dry white wines <br><br>
                The grape is planted in many different regions around the world, and the resulting wines can vary significantly in style. In general, Sauvignon blanc wines are best enjoyed young, although some producers do make aged versions that can develop complex flavours with time. Whether you’re a fan of dry or sweet white wines, chances are you’ve tried a Sauvignon blanc at some point. <br><br>
                Sauvignon blanc is a highly versatile wine that can be enjoyed both on its own and with food. Here are six reasons why it has become so popular: <br>
                1.	Sauvignon Blanc Has a Refreshing, Zesty Flavour That Makes It Perfect for Summer Drinking <br>
                Sauvignon blanc wines are usually light-bodied with high acidity. They often have flavours of citrus, green apple, and herbal notes. The best Sauvignon blancs have a balance of acidity and fruitiness, with a long mineral finish. When shopping for Sauvignon blanc, look for wines from cooler climates such as New Zealand or Chile. <br><br>
                These wines will have higher acidity and brighter fruit flavours. If you’re looking for a richer style of Sauvignon blanc, look for wines from warmer climates such as California or Australia. These wines will have softer acidity and more round, ripe fruit flavours. No matter what style you choose, make sure to serve your Sauvignon blanc chilled – it’s the perfect summer wine. <br><br>

                2. It is Relatively Low in Alcohol, So It is a Good Choice for People Who Want to Avoid Getting Too Drunk <br>
                This type of wine has an alcohol content of around 12 per cent, which is lower than many other types of wine. As a result, it is a good choice for people who want to avoid getting too drunk. In addition, sauvignon blanc is a refreshing and fruity wine, making it a great choice for summertime drinking. So if you’re looking for a light and refreshing wine, then sauvignon blanc is a good option. <br><br>
                3. Sauvignon Blanc is a Great Match for Food, Especially Seafood and Salads <br>
                Sauvignon blanc is one of the most versatile white wines when it comes to food pairing. Its high acidity and zesty citrus flavours make it a great match for lighter fare like seafood and salads. But it’s also delicate enough to pair with more delicate flavours like chicken and tofu.  <br>
                And because it’s not a very fruity wine, it’s also great for dishes with cream sauces or richer cheeses. So whether you are serving up fresh fish or a hearty pasta dish, Sauvignon blanc is always a good choice. <br><br>

                4. It is Relatively Inexpensive, So It is a Good Choice for Budget-minded Wine Drinkers <br>
                At first blush, Sauvignon blanc may not seem like a bargain wine. After all, it is often found on the wine lists of upscale restaurants, and it has garnered its fair share of awards over the years. However, compared to other premium white wines, Sauvignon blanc is relatively inexpensive. <br>
                This makes it a great choice for budget-minded wine drinkers who are looking for a high-quality bottle of wine. In addition, Sauvignon blanc is extremely versatile, pairs well with a wide range of foods, and is perfect for any occasion. <br><br>
                5. Sauvignon Blanc is Easy to Find, as It is Produced by Many Different Wineries Around the World <br>
                Sauvignon blanc is a versatile white wine that pairs well with a variety of foods. It is also easy to find, as it is produced by many different wineries around the world. The grape originated in France, and the name sauvignon blanc comes from the French word for “wild.” <br> <br>

                The grape is now planted in many different countries, including New Zealand, Chile, and the United States. <br>
                Sauvignon blanc wines can vary in taste, depending on where they are grown. In general, the wines are dry with high acidity levels. They often have strong aromas of citrus fruits, green bell peppers, and herbs. <br>
                When choosing a sauvignon blanc, look for a wine that has been made in a cool climate, such as New Zealand or Chile. These wines tend to be more crisp and refreshing than those made in warm <br><br>
                6. It is a Relatively Versatile Wine That Can Be Enjoyed Both Young and Old <br>
                When young, it is often characterised by its fresh, grassy flavours and aroma. However, as it ages, sauvignon blanc develops a more complex flavour profile, with notes of hay, straw, and even white chocolate. <br><br>
                While it can be enjoyed on its own, sauvignon blanc also pairs well with a variety of foods. Its acidity makes it a good match for light dishes such as salads or fish, while its richer flavours stand up well to poultry or pork. Whether you’re looking for a refreshing summertime sipper or a complex wintertime wine, sauvignon blanc is a good option to consider. <br><br>
                For all of these reasons, Sauvignon blanc is a popular choice among white wine drinkers. <br>
